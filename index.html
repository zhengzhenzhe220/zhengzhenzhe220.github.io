<h2>About me</h2>
<p>Welcome to my homepage! I am currently a tenure-track associate professor in the <a href="http://www.cs.sjtu.edu.cn/">Department of Computer Science and Engineering</a>
@ <a href="https://www.sjtu.edu.cn/">Shanghai Jiao Tong University</a>.</p>
<p>I received my Ph.D. from the <a href="http://www.cs.sjtu.edu.cn/">CS</a> department @ <a href="https://www.sjtu.edu.cn/">Shanghai Jiao Tong University</a> in March 2018.
My advisors were Prof. <a href="http://www.cs.sjtu.edu.cn/~fwu/">Prof. Fan Wu</a> and <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=rqZWbYgAAAAJ&amp;hl=en">Prof. Guihai Chen</a>.
I was a visiting research scholar and then a postdoctoral researcher in the <a href="https://www.csl.illinois.edu/">Coordinated Science Laboratory (CSL)</a> @ <a href="https://illinois.edu/">UIUC</a> from September 2016 to October 2019,
advised by Prof. <a href="https://sites.google.com/a/illinois.edu/srikant/">R. Srikant</a>.
I am the recipient of the <a href="https://www.ccf.org.cn/Awards/Awards_Recipients/2018/Doctoral_Dissertation/">China Computer Federation (CCF) Excellent Doctoral Dissertation Award</a> in 2018. During my Ph.D. program, I was supported by <a href="http://ai.googleblog.com/2015/08/announcing-googles-2015-global-phd.html">Google Ph.D. Fellowship</a> and <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/academic-program/fellowships-microsoft-research-asia/">Microsoft Research Asia Ph.D. Fellowship</a>.
Prior to my Ph.D., I received my B.E. in Software Engineering from <a href="https://www.xidian.edu.cn/">Xidian University</a> in June 2012, and M.S. in Computer Science from <a href="https://www.sjtu.edu.cn/">Shanghai Jiao Tong University</a> in March 2015.</p>
<p>My research interests are in the intersection of economics, learning and networking. In particular, I have focused on game theory, machine learning and their applications for intelligent mobile computing and online platform markets.</p>
<div class="infoblock">
<div class="blockcontent">
<p>Students: I am constantly looking for well motivated students (both undergrad and graduate) who are interested in
game theory, machine learning and reinforcement learning, networking and mobile computing, performance analysis and algorithm design, and system implementations.
Please email me if you are interested.</p>
