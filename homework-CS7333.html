<h1>Homework and Project</h1>
</div>
<p><b>Homework</b>: There will be about  homework sets, they will count for % of the final grade. Homework solutions will be handed out on the day that the homework is due. Late homework will be heavily discounted. Duplicating a solution that someone else has written or providing solutions to be copied is not acceptable. If you do collaborate on homework, you must cite, in your written solution, your collaborators.</p>
<p><b>Project</b>: There will be a term project, which accounts for 30% of the final grade. The project involves choosing a topic of your interest in game theory-mechanism design area, picking 2-3 major papers in the area, and understanding, critically evaluating, and possibly extending the research. You will need to write a project report and prepare a presentation in the final two weeks of classes.
We provide a reading list, which contains potential topics and major recent papers that are relevant. This is aimed at giving you a starting point. You are more than welcome to suggest other research topics and relevant papers.</p>
