== About me
Welcome to my homepage! I am currently a  professor in the [http://www.cs.sjtu.edu.cn/  School of Computer Science]
@ [https://www.sjtu.edu.cn/ Shanghai Jiao Tong University].

I received my Ph.D. from the [http://www.cs.sjtu.edu.cn/ CS] department @ [https://www.sjtu.edu.cn/ Shanghai Jiao Tong University] in March 2018.
My advisors were Prof. [http://www.cs.sjtu.edu.cn/~fwu/ Fan Wu] and [https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=rqZWbYgAAAAJ&hl=en Prof. Guihai Chen].
I was a visiting research scholar and then a postdoctoral researcher in the [https://www.csl.illinois.edu/ Coordinated Science Laboratory (CSL)] @ [https://illinois.edu/ UIUC] from September 2016 to October 2019,
advised by Prof. [https://sites.google.com/a/illinois.edu/srikant/ R. Srikant].
I am the recipient of the [https://www.ccf.org.cn/Awards/Awards_Recipients/2018/Doctoral_Dissertation/  China Computer Federation (CCF) Excellent Doctoral Dissertation Award] in 2018. During my Ph.D. program, I was supported by [http://ai.googleblog.com/2015/08/announcing-googles-2015-global-phd.html Google Ph.D. Fellowship] and [https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/academic-program/fellowships-microsoft-research-asia/ Microsoft Research Asia Ph.D. Fellowship].
#-Prior to my Ph.D., I received my B.E. in Software Engineering from [https://www.xidian.edu.cn/ Xidian University] in June 2012, and M.S. in Computer Science from [https://www.sjtu.edu.cn/ Shanghai Jiao Tong University] in March 2015.

My research interests are in the intersection of economics, learning and system. In particular, I have focused on game theory, machine learning, mobile computing and their applications for Agentic AI system, such as On-device AI Agents and Strategic AI Agents with applications to personal AI assistants and online platform markets.

~~~
*Students & Postdoc*: I am constantly looking for well motivated students (both undergrad and graduate) and Postdoc who are interested in
game theory, machine learning and reinforcement learning, mobile computing, performance analysis and algorithm design, and system implementations.
Please email me if you are interested.
