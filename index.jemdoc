== About me
Welcome to my homepage! I am currently a tenure-track assistant professor in the [http://www.cs.sjtu.edu.cn/  Department of Computer Science and Engineering]
@ [https://www.sjtu.edu.cn/ Shanghai Jiao Tong University].

I received my Ph.D. from the [http://www.cs.sjtu.edu.cn/ CS] department @ [https://www.sjtu.edu.cn/ Shanghai Jiao Tong University] in March 2018.
My advisors were Prof. [http://www.cs.sjtu.edu.cn/~fwu/ Prof. Fan Wu] and [https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=rqZWbYgAAAAJ&hl=en Prof. Guihai Chen].
I was then a postdoctoral researcher in the [https://www.csl.illinois.edu/ Coordinated Science Laboratory (CSL)] @ [https://illinois.edu/ UIUC] from April 2018 to October 2019,
advised by Prof. [https://sites.google.com/a/illinois.edu/srikant/ R. Srikant].
I was a visiting student working with Prof. [https://sites.google.com/a/illinois.edu/srikant/ R. Srikant] in
the [https://www.csl.illinois.edu/ Coordinated Science Laboratory (CSL)] @ [https://illinois.edu/ UIUC] from September 2016 to March 2018.
I am also a [http://ai.googleblog.com/2015/08/announcing-googles-2015-global-phd.html Google Ph.D. Fellow] and a [https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/academic-program/fellowships-microsoft-research-asia/ Microsoft Research Asia Fellow], in 2015.
Prior to my Ph.D., I received my B.E. in Software Engineering from [https://www.xidian.edu.cn/ Xidian University] in June 2012, and M.S. in Computer Science from [https://www.sjtu.edu.cn/ Shanghai Jiao Tong University] in March 2015.

My research interests are in the intersection of economics, learning and networking. In particular, I have focused on game theory, machine learning and their applications for computer networking, mobile computing and online markets.

~~~
Students: I am constantly looking for well motivated students (both undergrad and graduate) who are interested in
game theory, machine learning and reinforcement learning, networking and mobile computing, performance analysis and algorithm design, and system implementations.
Please email me if you are interested.
